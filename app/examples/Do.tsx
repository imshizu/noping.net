                        If you feel it's a bit brusque to simply say "Hi" and ask the question,

                        It may seem trivial, but asking your question before getting that initial salutatory reply
                        also allows for <strong>asynchronous communication</strong>. If the other party is away,
                        and you leave before they come back, they can still answer your question, instead of just
                        staring at a "Hello" and wondering what they missed.
