                        Note that Keith could have got this answer minutes sooner, and needn't have kept
                        Tim waiting. In fact, Tim could have started thinking about the question right away!
                        <br /><br />
                        People who do this are generally trying to be polite by not jumping right into the request, like one would in person or on the phone - and that's great! But it's 2022 and chat is neither of those things. For most people, typing is much slower than talking. So despite best intentions,
                        <strong>you're actually just making the other person wait</strong> for you to phrase your question, which is lost productivity (and kinda annoying).
